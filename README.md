# Portfolio-Projects
Projects that are either on my resume, or simply mean more to me.

Hey! Thanks for visiting. The files listed in this repository correlate to the projects listed on my resume. There are essentially 2 projects; a) A webscraping and data visualization project which analyzes a URL based on the Top 100 cover songs submitted for popular music, and b) A motion capture webcam application that incorporates the Bokeh Visualization library in python to capture the datetime's of anything that enters the webcam while it's in use!
